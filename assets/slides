# Flask Routes: Building APIs

---

## GET

1. Query for related instances (don't forget `.all()` or `.first()`, etc.)
2. Convert query into JSON-accessible format using `.to_dict`
3. Return response using `make_response()`

<aside class="notes">

- for jsonify you would have to build up the list/dictionary yourself
</aside>

---

## DELETE

1. Query for the single instance and save in a variable
2. Use `db.session.delete(query_instance)` to delete the row
3. Commit this change to the database with `db.session.commit()`
4. Return a response with an empty JSON object

---

## POST 

1. Create a new instance with values from the request
2. Add the new instance to the session using `db.session.add(new_instance)`
3. Commit this change to the database with `db.session.commit()`
4. Return a JSON response with the new instance and a status code of 201

---

## Getting JSON from the request

- It all depends on the content type passed into the request

---

- `request.form`: key/value pairs in the HTML POST form that isn't JSON encoded
- `request.form['key']` if key definitely exists
- `request.form.get('key')` if key may not exist

<aside class="notes">

- for x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form data
- multipart/form-data: header content-type: multipart/form-data
    - good for files, non-ASCII, binary data, large data
    - contains some sort of boundary?
- www-form-urlencoded: content-type: x-www-form-urlencoded
    - use for simple text fields, body is essentially one giant query string
</aside>

---

- `request.args`: key value pairs in the URL query string

<aside class="notes">

- `to_dict()` is enabled by flask-serialize
- `make_response` allows you to add custom headers - mostly used for returning Flask views

</aside>

---

- `request.values`: multipurpose for form body and url query when they overlap

---

- ➡️ `request.get_json()`: parse json data from body ⬅️

<aside class="notes">

- does not get included in request.values since json is not part of a large query string
</aside>

---

## PATCH

1. Get the appropriate class instance by id
2. Loop through all the attributes in request: `for attr in request.form`
3. Replace in class instance accordingly: `setattr(instance, attr, request.form.get(attr))`
4. Add and commit in session
5. Return json response with updated value and status code 200
